===========

Emulate Google's filmography converyer belt when googling an actor
eg. "Leonardo DiCaprio movies"

See working demo:

Things you can play with on site:
* Responsive (when window is small enough, we see the 'Scroll Spy' in action. Reflects how far down the user has scrolled)
* Click on movie images
* Click on left or right arrows on conveyer belt (or mouse scroll up and down)

Stack:
* MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node)
* AWS
* Linux (and yes I configured init.d to run the server on boot: thank you https://github.com/chovy/node-startup)
