filmography
===========

Emulate Google's filmography converyer belt when googling an actor
eg. "Leslie Cheung movies"

See working demo:

http://theodoreli.github.io/filmographyGHP

Things to do:
*Click on movie images
*Click on left or right arrows on conveyer belt
*If you resize the window small enough, we get to see the 'scrollSpy' in action. This essentially is a portion of the navigation that reacts to how far the user has scrolled down the page

Not complete yet by any means, a major work in progress. 

This is built using Yeoman Angular Fullstack generator. Will use a real DB in the future instead of the client injected values
