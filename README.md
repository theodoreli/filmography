filmography
===========

Emulate Google's filmography converyer belt when googling an actor
eg. "Leslie Cheung movies"

See working demo:

http://www.theodoreli.com

Things to do:
* Click on movie images
* Click on left or right arrows on conveyer belt
* If you resize the window small enough, we get to see the 'scrollSpy' in action. This essentially is a portion of the navigation that reacts to how far the user has scrolled down the page
* test responsiveness

Not complete yet by any means, a major work in progress. 

Stack:
* MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node)
* AWS
* Linux (and yes I configured init.d to run the server on boot: thank you https://github.com/chovy/node-startup)
